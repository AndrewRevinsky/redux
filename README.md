Atomic Flux with hot reloading.


## Why another Flux framework?

Read **[The Evolution of Flux Frameworks](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/the-evolution-of-flux-frameworks-6c16ad26bb31)** for some context.

## The Talk

Redux was demoed together with **[React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)** at React Europe.  
Watch **[Dan Abramov's talk on Hot Reloading with Time Travel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs).**
